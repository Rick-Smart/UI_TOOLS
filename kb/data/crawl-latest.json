Request Unemployment Benefit Records Arizona Employment Service Registration Unemployment Insurance Fraud It is a felony to misrepresent or fail to disclose facts or to make false statements in order to obtain or increase benefits. If you knowingly make a false statement or withhold information in order to collect unemployment insurance benefits to which you are not entitled, the Arizona Department of Economic Security may take civil or criminal action against you. Criminal action may result in a fine and/or imprisonment. In addition, you will be required to repay the amount you received illegally as well as penalty amounts which are added to each week that was fraudulently claimed. As part of our fraud prevention efforts, the Department regularly conducts several types of audits to detect improper benefit payments. View more information about Unemployment Insurance Fraud .

When you file a new claim for unemployment benefits, a Deputy from the DES UI Administration takes fact-finding steps to determine if you are eligible for benefits. These steps may include contacting you (the claimant), the former employer, or both. How We Notify You of an Overpayment If you are paid benefits that you should not have received based on the facts of your case, DES will issue a Determination of Overpayment notice . Claimants with UI claims will receive this notice via the CACTUS web portal. View the Non-fraud Overpayment Determination example . Please note: the versions of this notice may vary depending on the specifics of your overpayment. Understanding The Notices You Received The Determination of Eligibility notice is sent to inform you that you were paid benefits and then were determined ineligible based on the facts of your case. The Determination of Overpayment notice includes information about your particular overpayment, including: Your claim ID#, case ID# and date of your claim The classification (type) of your overpayment The reason you were not eligible for the benefits The total amount due How to appeal this determination Your rights as a claimant Information that explains how to pay back the overpayment If DES applied a waiver to your overpayment or did not, and how to request a waiver It’s important that you read through the entire notice. Overpayment Classifications When an overpayment is identified, the overpayment is classified into one of three classifications: Administrative: An administrative overpayment is an overpayment that occurred at no fault of your own. Non-fraud: A non-fraud overpayment occurs when you unintentionally give the Department incomplete or incorrect information or failed to correct erroneous information. Fraud: A fraud overpayment occurs when you knowingly misrepresented or concealed material facts to obtain benefits to which you were not lawfully entitled. The classification of your overpayment is important because there are different penalties, interest, and offset percentages applied depending on the classification type. If the classification on your overpayment is “Fraud/Fraudulent” or “Non-fraud/Non-Fraudulent” and you do not agree with the classification of overpayment, you may appeal the classification within 15 days of the issued date of your Determination of Overpayment notice. Where can I find more information about my particular overpayment? Specifics about your overpayment can be found in the Determination of Overpayment notice that is issued to claimants who received UI benefits. The notice will include the facts surrounding the overpayment and the reason why DES determined you were not eligible for the benefits you received, including if the overpayment occurred: After identifying facts that made you ineligible for benefits (i.e. the Determination of Deputy steps) As a result of an Appeal Decision As a result of a revised Wage Statement As a result of unreported earnings Learn about overpayments and overpayment materials .

In Arizona, it is a Class VI Felony to misrepresent or fail to disclose facts or to make false statements in order to obtain or increase your Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits. If you knowingly make a false statement or withhold information in order to collect UI benefits to which you are not entitled, the Arizona Department of Economic Security may take civil or criminal action against you. Criminal action may result in up to 2 years in prison and fines up to $150,000 for each false statement. Meaning, if you fraudulently receive 10 weeks of UI benefits to which you were not entitled, each week is considered as a separate false statement and you could receive up to 20 years maximum in prison and a $150,000 fine for each offense. UI Fraud Convictions Quarterly Report The following report lists the names and sentences of individuals convicted of UI fraud. Investigations were conducted by investigators assigned to the UI Unit of the DES Office of Special Investigations and prosecuted by the Arizona Attorney General's Office, Child and Family Protection Division. These court convictions are a matter of public record. Note: while the information provided is factual, there are often individuals who have the same or similar names.

You must have earned sufficient wages in your base period to qualify for a claim in order to receive benefit payments. Your Wage Statement (UB-107) will show a weekly benefit amount and total award if you've earned enough wages to qualify. If there are other eligibility issues , they must be resolved before any payments are issued to you. In the example shown below, the first week of unemployment on a newly established benefit year is a waiting week *. If there are no issues established on your claim, you can expect your first benefit payment** (normally after you've filed your second weekly claim) within approximately 10 business days. As mentioned above, if there are eligibility issues that need to be resolved; for example, if you received severance or payment for unused vacation or sick leave, someone has to verify the amount, the dates, and other information before issuing a decision and clearing your claim for payment. View more information about eligibility issues . In most cases where there is an issue, the first payment can usually be processed within 15 business days (if you are determined eligible for benefits). For the remainder, it can take longer. All of this depends on whether you are determined eligible for benefits and file your weekly claims for each week you remain unemployed. Note: If you skip or miss filing more than two consecutive benefit weeks, your claim becomes inactive. View information about filing weekly claims . Will I receive a check in the mail or how will payments be made? If you qualify for UI benefits, you will automatically be enrolled in the Electronic Payment Card (EPC) program. You should receive your EPC card by mail within a week after your initial application is processed; provided you are monetarily eligible (refer to your Wage Statement UB-107). Your EPC card will have a zero balance until your first benefit payment has processed. View information about our Electronic Payment Card . How long will my benefits last? You may have up to 26 weeks of UI benefit payments, depending on how much you earned in your base period . If you return to work or if you have deductible income for any week, you may collect more or less than 26 weeks. The total amount you can collect for the year is the maximum benefit amount shown on your Wage Statement (monetary determination). Can I check the status of my payments online? You can find all of the following information either online or by phone: View the latest benefit payment made to you; Obtain information about the last week you filed if you did not receive a payment; and Check the balance remaining on your current claim. Benefit payment information may also be viewed for the most recently completed calendar year (for tax purposes). Visit our Income Tax Information page for more information. Instructions for checking your claim status online: Access the Weekly Claims system and after choosing \"English\" or \"Spanish\", enter your Social Security Number and click the \"View Payment Info\" tab. To check by phone: Call the Telephone Information and Payment System , and select Option 2 for the latest payment made to you, or information about the last week you filed if you did not receive a payment, and the balance remaining on your current claim. View more information about the telephone options available for other various UI claim inquiries. If you checked your Unemployment Insurance benefit status (as outlined above) and it shows benefits were paid, but the balance on your Electronic Payment Card (EPC) is zero, please contact the Way2Go card® call center toll-free at 1-833-915-4041, TTY: 877-427-4172, or by Direct International at 1-214-210-2249. I think I'm missing a payment, who do I contact? If you have checked your claim Information online or by phone and find that a payment was issued and the amount is not showing up on your EPC/debit card or in your checking/savings account (if you've chosen to receive payments via direct deposit); you must contact the Way2Go card® call center toll-free at 1-833-915-4041, TTY: 877-427-4172, or by Direct International at 1-214-210-2249 (for EPC/debit card funds) or your personal bank/credit union (for funds that were made via direct deposit). Benefits are no longer sent via paper checks as part of the Department's effort to reduce costs. However, a few individuals receive temporary paper checks by mail. If your paper check is missing, lost, or stolen, please complete the Unemployment Insurance Benefits Missing/Lost/Stolen Checks form immediately.
